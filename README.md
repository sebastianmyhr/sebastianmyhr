### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sebastian, a Computer Science Student at Northwestern interested in exploring back end software engineering, data engineering, machine learning, and data science. Welcome to my GitHub. This year, I'm working on building out my portfolio.\

Outside of programming, I enjoy sailing, photography, reading, and being in the outdoors. Here's a picture I took.
